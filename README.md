## üöÄ WHAT IS MINISHELL ??

This repo aims to centralize all kinds of ressources for getting a better understanding of 42 project called `minishell`.

The `minihell` project at 42 immerses students in UNIX shell development using C, focusing on system calls, process management, and parsing.

It challenges them to create a minimalistic shell with fundamental UNIX command-line functionalities, fostering skills in system-level programming and imparting practical knowledge of core shell components.

What's this repo ?

The creation of this GitHub repo was the result of a reflection among 42 students during our minishell project: far too many of us (myself included) are unfamiliar with Github collaboration tools, and we all lack training in them.

So I created this repo with two main goals in mind:

- Centralize and organize resources of all kinds (shell scripts and other languages, explanatory README.md files, stackoverflow web resources) to give an overview of the minishell project.

- Be a training ground for GitHub collaboration tools (pull request creation, Git Issues, .md file redactions).

Miniwhat ?

Cool cool, what now ?

Did you create a custom Python Script for checking a minishell specific requirement ?

Or maybe a useful readme.md where you explain useful infos?
