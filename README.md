## [**REPO SUMMARY**](https://github.com/maitreverge/minishell_101/tree/fa7aa41f274a86e0df12822a12d2d8b54bafdb89/sommaire)

## üöÄ WHAT IS MINISHELL ?

The `minihell` project at 42 immerses students in UNIX shell development using C, focusing on system calls, process management, and parsing.

It challenges them to create a minimalistic shell with fundamental UNIX command-line functionalities, fostering skills in system-level programming and imparting practical knowledge of core shell components.

## ü§î WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS REPO ?

The creation of this GitHub repo was the result of a reflection among 42 students during our minishell project: far too many of us (myself included) are unfamiliar with Github collaboration tools, and we all lack training in them.

So I created this repo with two main goals in mind:

- **Centralize** and **organize** resources of all kinds (*shell scripts and other languages, explanatory README.md files, stackoverflow web resources*) to give an `minishell` project overview for future students.

- Be a common **training ground** for GitHub collaboration tools (*Pull Request creation, Git Issues, .md file redactions*).

## ü§ù WHAT CAN I SHARE /  HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE ?

You're going to create a üò±**PULL REQUEST**üò±.
I know I know, this is scary... you can do it !

[**Unfamiliar with pull requests ? Click Here !**](https://googlethatforyou.com/?q=how%20to%20make%20a%20github%20pull%20request)

- Did you create a custom Python Script for checking a minishell specific requirement ?

- You wrote a useful readme.md where you explain useful infos?

- You found a usefull ressource about bash ?

Open a Pull Request, and **don't be afraid to mess things up** !


For keeping everything nice and intelligible, here is the global structure of the repo :

‚ö†Ô∏è**I'd expect two things from you** ‚ö†Ô∏è :

- Add a directory with your GitHub username in the [**ressources directoy**](https://github.com/maitreverge/minishell_101/tree/fa7aa41f274a86e0df12822a12d2d8b54bafdb89/ressources).
Try to make your work as explicit and comprehensible as possible (*with a README.md for example*)

- Link your work in the [**summary README.md**](https://github.com/maitreverge/minishell_101/blob/fa7aa41f274a86e0df12822a12d2d8b54bafdb89/sommaire/README.md)
(*fell free to add a category within this file if your work doesn't match any*)

From here, you are absolutely free to organize your files as you wish !
