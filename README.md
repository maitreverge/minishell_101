## [**GO TO SUMMARY**](https://github.com/maitreverge/minishell_101/tree/fa7aa41f274a86e0df12822a12d2d8b54bafdb89/sommaire)



## üöÄ WHAT IS MINISHELL ?

The `minihell` project at 42 immerses students in UNIX shell development using C, focusing on system calls, process management, and parsing.

It challenges them to create a minimalistic shell with fundamental UNIX command-line functionalities, fostering skills in system-level programming and imparting practical knowledge of core shell components.  

## ü§î WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS REPO ?

The creation of this GitHub repo was the result of a reflection among 42 students during our minishell project:

**far too many of us (myself included) are unfamiliar with Github collaboration tools, and we all trully lacking training with them.**

So I created this repo to kill two birds with one stone:

- **Centralize** and **organize** resources of all kinds (*shell scripts and other languages, explanatory README.md files, unique web resources*) to give a `minishell` project overview for students.

- Be a common **training ground** for GitHub collaboration tools (*Pull Request creation, Git Issues, .md file redactions*).

## ü§ù WHAT CAN I SHARE /  HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE ?

You're going to create a üò±**PULL REQUEST**üò±.

I know I know, scary adult stuff... you can do it !

[**Unfamiliar with pull requests ? Click Here !**](https://googlethatforyou.com/?q=how%20to%20make%20a%20github%20pull%20request)

- Did you create a custom Python Script for checking a minishell specific requirement ?

- You wrote a useful readme.md where you explain useful infos?

- You found a usefull ressource about bash ?

Open a Pull Request, and **don't be afraid to mess things up** !


For keeping everything nice and intelligible, here is the global structure of the repo :
