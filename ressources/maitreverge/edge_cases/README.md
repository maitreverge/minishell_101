## ðŸš€ WHAT ARE EDGE CASES ?

During my `minishell` project, I went through some Github testers, most of them are *happy paths* tests.

Unfortunatelly (*for us*), `bash` treat every cases regardless of your feelings or emotions.

My goal here is trying to list as much prompts that I tested along the way of building `minishell`.

Some of them makes sense, some of them helped me grasp a better sense of what's `bash`.

Sometimes, ***meh*** ðŸ¤· prompts doesn't makes sense at all...


I'll provide a few explanations on specific commands, a few insights sometimes...

> Keep in mind that some commands will **crush your sould and destrooy your will to live with the efficiency of a bulldozer**.



> ðŸ¤” Does it means that my `minishell` is rubish for not handling a specific edge case ?

Well, not necessarly. My minishell **sucks**, yours maybe a little more or a little less, but you're not supposed to handle everything !

> ðŸ¤” Where do I draw the line between edges cases ?

Well, you chosse. Handle everything asked in the subject is a good start. Draw the line yourself, and âœ¨enjoy the processâœ¨.
